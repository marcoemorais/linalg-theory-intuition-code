# linear algebra: theory, intuition, code

This repo contains jupyter notebooks with notes, code snippets, and the end of chapter exercises from the book _Linear Algebra: Theory, Intuition, Code_ by Mike X Cohen (Cohen, 2021). My intent with this repo was not to reproduce all of the details from the book. Instead I created these notebooks as I worked through the book in order to engage more deeply with the material using my own code snippets. Even though I have taken semester-long courses in linear algebra and a graduate course in numerical analysis, I was able to get a lot of benefit from the material in the book.
